# rock-paper-scissors

One of the many mandatory projects for becoming a developer. A simple rock-paper-scissors app made with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Lessons Learned

The bare minimum was used to make this game. Focused on the vanilla aspect of web development without the need for web hosting or dev environments. Refreshed my knowledge on the fundamentals of web development.

Reinforced my understanding of the DOM and its interaction with files of the project. Learned how to add effects to objects upon a change of state (e.g. flashiing green/red when win/lose).

## Possible Future Features

* Refactoring all JS funcitons to use ES6 syntax.
* Public scoreboard and online accounts.
* Different themes to choose from.

## Deployment

This site was deployed using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
